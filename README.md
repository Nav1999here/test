 #new to this platform so just testing how things works

its a simple python project 'ENGLISH THESAURUS' 
this program asks for a word as an input from the user and the prog returns the defination of that word
if the word is slightly mispelled it asks for the confirmation from the user by getting close matches for the the mispelled word and returns the defination after the confirmation
its not even case sensitive.

What kind of modifications can u suggest?
